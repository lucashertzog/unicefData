## v1.5.0

- Versions aligned across languages (Python, R, Stata) to 1.5.0.
- Defaults clarified and unified: `_T` used for sex/age/wealth/residence/maternal_edu where applicable; auto-detects dataflow per indicator.
- Python: Converted dimensions check into pytest (`tests/test_dimensions.py`), added SDMX `TimeDimension` handling; tests green with coverage.
- R: Added `get_unicef()` wrapper and `list_dataflows()` alias; exposed `.fetch_sdmx`; scripted test harness passes (6/6).
- Stata: Verified discovery commands and samples; README examples regenerated; package metadata updated.
- Docs: NEWS/CHANGELOG refreshed; markdown formatting cleaned; cache locations documented per language.

Release artifacts:
- Python package: installable via editable mode; CI tests with coverage.
- R package: R-CMD-check workflow and scripted tests workflow.
- Stata: ado/help/pkg version headers updated to 1.5.0.

Next steps:
- Tag `v1.5.0` and publish a GitHub Release pointing to these notes.
- Monitor CI across Python 3.8–3.11 and R matrix; address any transient network-related skips as needed.
