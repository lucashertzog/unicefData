  - One out of 238 EAs was not visited due to bad weather
  - Two clusters could not be visited due to insecurity and evictions during the field
    work period
  - Child functioning for 5-17 excludes reported difficulties walking 500 m; 41 out
    of the 880 selected enumeration areas could not be visited because they were inaccessible
    due to security and safety reasons during the fieldwork period.
  - Only one (1) of the selected enumeration districts was not visited because of
    safety concerns during the fieldwork period
  - Age is 3-4 years
  - Only social transfers, no educational support collected
  - Age is 3-17 years
  - Age is 5-17 years; the question on communication "the child has difficulty being
    understood by people outside of the household" is not collected
  - 'In Qatar MICS 2023 questions related to difficulties walking 500 m for the children
    5-17 years were removed and the walking domain refers to difficulties walking
    100 m. The child functioning module did not include two domains: Depression and
    Accepting Change.'
  - The locally adjusted CFM module was administered and is not fully comparable to
    the standard CFM. The child functioning concept encompasses health problems that
    may impact the overall low prevalence. Also collected data on impairment and it
    appears that the two concepts have been combined in the overall % in Table 1 and
    CFM only in Table 14. So the numerator of % is derived from Table 14 and the denominator
    is from Table 1
