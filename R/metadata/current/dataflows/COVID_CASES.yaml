  top_values: Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age and sex are only available
    for a limited number of countries for the time period 2020-2022. Where data exist,
    quality varies widely and reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths may be incomplete
    or suffer from low coverage. Additionally, to develop standardized age-disaggregated
    data some redistribution and recalculation methods have been applied. Due to the
    rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and limitations in data collection
    systems, data may also be out of date by the time of publication. These data should
    be interpreted with caution and may deviate substantially from the true number
    of COVID-19 cases and deaths in a subset of countries with limited data.
