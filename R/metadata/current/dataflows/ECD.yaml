  - Work is underway to populate the UNICEF global database with historical country-level
    data.
  - While trend data are available, changes in the indicator definitions, age groups
    covered, as well as the measures and questions used to collect the information
    have changed over time. These factors affect the comparability of available data
    sources and require careful review and assessment in order to accurately and reliably
    draw conclusions about trends over time for most countries. For this reason, trend
    data for this indicator are not included in UNICEF global databases.
